# BACKEND-Search-User-By-Name

In this backend app all the api calls which are required for the application has been made, But this backend application is much useful only when we have database or when we include more functionalities to the application, but since there are only api requests are required which can be easily handled at the client side\

**Working of application**\

=>  first of all an express server is created \

=>  All the required URLs has been declared for the GET apis\

=>  For a success api call we will get a 200 response status\

=>  In this server we will be having two apis one for to get the profile ("/getProfile") of the user and other to get the repositories of the user ("/getRepo")\

=>  both the apis are declared asynchronously\

=>  As we get the information from the api we will send the data back to the frontend\


As zender is much useful to deploy the webservice
